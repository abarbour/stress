Version 1.2 -> 1.21:
    No of Iteration steps can be given manually, the default is (as with version
    1.2 set to 1500).
Version 1.21 -> 1.22:    
    option -H to give number of headerlines in inputfile, default is one line header Version 1.21 -> 1.22:    
Version 1.22 -> 1.3: 
    distance weight rtwf and twf can also be used for constant smoothing radius option  
Version 1.3 -> 1.4: 
    Interactive mode for calculating trajectories
Version 1.41 -> 1.42:
    Changed output format for sdat slightly, numbers were sticking together.    
Version 1.42 -> 1.5:
    error in distance weighting (rtwf together with -A option)
    both distance weightings possible for -A or -N option
Version 1.5 -> 1.51:
    when writing trajectories the deviation is given in the third column. This 
    can be read by the GMT script and be used to display the deviation in color.
Version 1.51 -> 1.52:     
    -I Option applies to trajectories too.
Version 1.52 -> 1.53:
    Warning included if iteration didn't suceed    
Version 1.53 -> 2.0:
    Removed error when calculating -S .sdat . The stress field at these points
     did not coincide with the grdm and .trjs. 
    Changed notation of weightingfunctions according to my diss.
     nid -> pdf (only in the input, internally not changed up to now
     rnid -> rpdf
    Added new weightingfunction:
     ntwf: rescaling not by summ of all weights but by number of NN 
     npdf: rescaling not by summ of all weights but by number of NN         
Version 2.102 UNUSED: different weighting sheme, not so sucessfull for data.
Version 2.2: additional number of data in bins weighting
     nbtwf or nbpdf: for using with -A option
